### What you can do:
1. Make sure the VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable contains a valid API key from Google AI Studio
2. Ensure the API key has been properly activated and has the necessary permissions
3. Check if there are any rate limiting issues with your current API key

For testing purposes, you can proceed with a demo audit report instead.`;

## Executive Summary
This smart contract was analyzed for potential security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and adherence to best practices. The audit identified several issues of varying severity that should be addressed before deploying to mainnet.

## Findings Summary
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | 0     |
| High     | 1     |
| Medium   | 2     |
| Low      | 3     |
| Info     | 2     |

## Detailed Findings

### High: Missing Access Control
The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms which could lead to unauthorized operations. Critical functions should be protected with modifiers like 'onlyOwner' or role-based access control.

\`\`\`solidity
// Vulnerable function without access control
function store(uint256 value) public {
    _value = value;
    emit ValueChanged(value);
}
\`\`\`

Recommended implementation:

\`\`\`solidity
// With access control
function store(uint256 value) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
    _value = value;
    emit ValueChanged(value);
}
\`\`\`

### Medium: Integer Overflow/Underflow
Potential for arithmetic overflow/underflow in numerical operations. Consider using SafeMath or Solidity 0.8.0+ which has built-in overflow checking.

### Medium: Lack of Input Validation
The contract does not validate inputs which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

### Low: Missing Events
Some state-changing functions don't emit events, making it difficult to track changes off-chain.

### Low: No Function Comments
Functions lack NatSpec comments which reduces code readability and documentation.

### Low: Gas Optimization
Several functions could be optimized for lower gas consumption.

## Recommendations
1. Implement proper access control using OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract
2. Use SafeMath for arithmetic operations if using Solidity < 0.8.0
3. Add comprehensive input validation to all public functions
4. Emit events for all state changes
5. Add NatSpec comments to all functions
6. Consider gas optimizations where appropriate

This audit was performed using automated tools and manual review. While comprehensive, it cannot guarantee the absence of all possible vulnerabilities.`;
